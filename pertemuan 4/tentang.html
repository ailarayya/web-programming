    <h1> TMII Then and now </h1>
    <p> Thousands of traditional patterns and cultures paint stories in every corner of the archipelago, from Sabang to Merauke, presenting an identity as the image of each region in Indonesia. They inspired the former First Lady Siti Hartinah, affectionately known as Mrs. Tien Soeharto, to envision the establishment of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah or TMII. <br>

        Born out of the dream of the Former First Lady who wished to take her people on a journey through the stories of Indonesia in an open park, TMII was inaugurated in April 1975 as a conservation and cultural development area. The diversity of Indonesia’s 33 provinces is encapsulated in the form of miniature archipelagos, regional pavilions, traditional buildings and architecture, regional arts, recreational parks, and various other forms of entertainment. A 150-hectare land was transformed into a stage for art, recreation, and education for visitors of all ages.<br>
        
        Several decades have passed until finally, on September 1, 2023, TMII introduced a transformation through the innovative and revolutionary new face of TMII. The #NewFaceTMII (#WajahBaruTMII) carries four pillars: green, inclusive, culture, and smart. The green pillar in TMII presents an eco-park where 70 percent of the area is low-emission green space. The inclusive pillar includes all layers of society to share in cultural performances, while the culture pillar brings forth a recreational destination that encapsulates cultural patterns and arts, making visitors the main actors in every activity at TMII. Lastly, the smart pillar completes the new face of TMII through the implementation of an easy and practical digital platform for exploring TMII.<br>
